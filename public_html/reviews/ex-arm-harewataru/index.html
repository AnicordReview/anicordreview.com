          <h1>Fall 2024</h1>
          <h1>Trash Special</h1>
          <h1>12/12 Episodes</h1>
          <p>after dropping this show a year ago and memeing about it for a long time, it seems that karma has come back to bite me.</p>

          <p>first of all, the most obvious thing is that this everything about the artstyle/animation is garbage. how the hell did this air in 2021?????// throughout the show, the cgi was unbearable, some sound effects DONT even play, the fights were so static,  facial expressions were weird at some points, kissing was censored, explosions looked so bad, some characters looked like they were designed in the 1990s, everything was so visually disgusting i wondered to myself why i even joined the trash special. the only redeeming things were the VAs and the op (which i actually kinda like lol?)</p>

          <p>that aside, the story idea was so-so. akira becomes ex-arm and destroys other ex-arms because they are "deadly weapons". i could kinda understand it, but the way the show executed the ideas were just awful. pacing was so horrible and there were major "skips" in between moments, leading to plot points just being left unmentioned such as the auction bit? also at the fights when beta controlled the robots, it was just a mess. i was just genuinely confused at most points trying to keep up, and after beta's death it just got more confusing for me. characters were somewhat okay, but not memorable (akira was so boring and generic, ygg's introduction was weird and difficult for me to know what she does) other than minami, which i did appreciate her development and story when her family died in her attack.</p>

          <p>the only way i felt any sort of enjoyment was when i stopped taking the show seriously (even though it seemed like it was trying be serious?) and started watching it as a comedy anime. because there definitely were funny parts that i laughed at times, especially in episode 5.</p>

          <p>overall i have nothing to say, this show is really really trash but i enjoyed it when i ignored the plot. this show was atrocious, dreadful, horrible, horrendous, abysmal, appalling, ghastly, lamentable, deplorable, pathetic, dire, woeful, disastrous, inferior, lackluster, miserable, subpar, unsatisfactory, pitiful, shoddy, abominable, grotesque, cringeworthy, reprehensible, intolerable, excruciating, hideous, repugnant, distasteful, faulty, deficient, flawed, disgraceful, egregious, disappointing, unpleasant, unsavory, inadequate, substandard, unbearable, repulsive, insulting, embarrassing, lackadaisical, amateurish, vapid, uninspired, underwhelming, grotesque, pitiable and TRASH.</p>
